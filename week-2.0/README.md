## Pracetice Javascript and Python

- Using JavaScript and Python to finish functions.
- Using Loops, JavaScript object and array, Python list and dictionary.
- Functions with double parentheses in JavaScript and Python.
- Learn Time Complexity, Big O Notation, Algorithms, and calculating time complexity.
- Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.
- The time complexity of Q1 to Q6 are O(N)、O(N)、O(1)、O(N^2)、O(N^2)、O(N).
